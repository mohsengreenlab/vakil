Now, I want to deploy this web app to my Ubuntu VPS. Provide a complete, step-by-step deployment plan and carry it out accordingly. Use clear, descriptive steps. The plan must prioritize isolation and guarantee zero conflicts with what’s already running.

WHAT’S ALREADY ON THE VPS (RESERVED DOMAINS/PORTS)
- FreePaper → daneshmehr.org (reverse-proxied) → local port 8000
- Kerit → kerit.com.ru + www.kerit.com.ru → local port 3001 (plus a webhook on 3002)
- SmartCover → smartcover.kerit.com.ru → local port 3004 (behind Cloudflare)
- TrustLine → trustline.chat → local port 3003
- TopTeachers → topteachers.online → local port 3005
- PartnerSystems → partnersystems.online + www.partnersystems.online → local port 3006
- SiahRokh → no domain yet → local port 3007
Reserved app ports in use: 8000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005, 3006, 3007.
Do NOT alter or restart any existing apps, domains, or certificates.

PRIMARY GOALS
1) Deploy the new app in a fully isolated way (its own user/service, its own data and logs, its own domain/subdomain, and its own internal port that is NOT one of the reserved ports above).
2) Expose it through the existing NGINX reverse proxy pattern using a unique domain/subdomain (no overlap with the domains listed above).
3) Enable HTTPS for the new domain without touching certificates for existing domains.
4) Wire it to the EXTERNAL SingleStore database using adjustable settings (host, port, db name, user, password, SSL mode, and pool sizes) that I can change later without code changes.

SINGLESTORE (EXTERNAL DB) REQUIREMENTS
- Provide a clear place to set these values: DB HOST, DB PORT, DB NAME, DB USER, DB PASSWORD, SSL/TLS options, and connection pool limits.
- Assume these values may change. Make sure I can update them later without changing code (e.g., through per-app variables/secrets). Document exactly how I will update them and safely restart just the NEW app without affecting others.
- Add a readiness/health step so the app won’t start serving until it can reach the database (and fails gracefully if credentials are wrong).
- Include a short rollback plan if new DB settings break the app.
