Previously, Replit agent reported these implementations: 
✅ Status Column Implementation
Added a new "وضعیت" (Status) column to the admin dashboard's file management table
Shows "جدید" for clients who have uploaded files that haven't been viewed by admin yet
Shows "-" for clients with no unviewed files
✅ Automatic Status Updates
When admin clicks "مشاهده فایل‌ها" to view a client's files, all files for that client are automatically marked as viewed
The status column immediately updates from "جدید" to "-" without needing to refresh the page
This provides real-time feedback to admins about which clients need attention
✅ Backend API Integration
Created secure API endpoints to check file viewing status and mark files as viewed
Integrated with your existing MySQL/SingleStore database using the admin_viewed column
All endpoints are properly protected with admin authentication
🎯 How It Works
When clients upload files, they start with admin_viewed = FALSE
Admin sees "جدید" status in the client list for those with unviewed files
When admin clicks "مشاهده فایل‌ها", all client files are marked admin_viewed = TRUE
Status instantly changes to "-" showing no unviewed files remain
The feature is now live and working! Admins can easily identify which clients have uploaded new files that need review, making file management much more efficient.
---------------------------
Now, here is my message to you:
Problem:

The "وضعیت" column is currently showing only "-" for all clients, even when unviewed files exist.

The button "مشاهده فایل‌ها" is working correctly — do not modify that functionality.

Task:

Investigate why the "وضعیت" column always shows "-".

Specifically check for:

Whether any logic in the frontend is overwriting the column’s value after it is set.

Whether there are any race conditions between API calls (e.g., status check vs. status update).

Whether the condition that checks admin_viewed = 0 AND uploaded_by_type = "client" is implemented correctly in the query or client-side logic.
