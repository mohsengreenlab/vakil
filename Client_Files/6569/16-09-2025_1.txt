Okay. He has such pillows, such assholes. Hi, yes, yes, hi, hi, I can hear you perfectly. It is good, yeah, I can hear you perfectly. Oh, the quality is just great, everything is just great, don't change anything. Uh... Okay. That's okay. That's fine. That's fine. You asked about my day, but before that, oh my god, I love the video with the cat that you sent me. And... Okay. Okay. Alright, you asked about my day. But now it's better. Now there's no gap. Okay, okay. I'm doing well. Today I... Sorry. Today I talked to my friend. He... Oh, ok, ok. I'm going. He doesn't live in Russia. Of course. He doesn't live in Russia very well. Yeah. "Sigodnaya" Sorry. "Sigodnaya ya rabotal?" "Vot ifso ati?" Okay. Yeah. Of course, it's LGBT, of course. Yeah. Yeah, I memorized. I have to memorize them. Yeah, yeah, because there's no logic behind it. I mean, in Russian language, you can never find your logic, honestly. So that's why, yeah, that's why you have to memorize instead of using your logic. That's how, yeah. Oh yeah, of course. For example, let's say you want to say, I got full mark in physics, So in Russian you say "po fizika" Am I right? "po" you use "po" So "fizika" "po fizika" right? Okay "po fizika" Now it's interesting Oh "po fizika" But the point is this meaning of "po" is not in the Best dictionary that I use online so in that best dictionary that there is online. Let me hold on. Let me let me open Honey can you say it again so sorry? Oh my god, yeah, yeah, true, true, true, true. I need some time to finish this thing. So, yeah, in this dictionary that I use online, and it's really good, There are eight meanings of the word p√•, allowing about... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Along about, by the means of, for example, po telefonu, po telefonu, means by the means of, yeah, a punch or hit somewhere after a certain age to, on the subject of, and on, like on weekdays. So po can also use for weekdays. But this meaning that... But this meaning of "po fizike" This meaning is not among these eight meanings, you know, so yeah, that's why you can never find logic actually Yeah So besides, I also... Okay, getting back to English. So I went to the market and I upgraded my car's key. It needed some upgrade. And so what happened was that there's this electric remote that opens a door, but I wanted to extend the range of that remote. So that's why I changed its size. Yeah, if you upgrade the board, you saw that board. So I just replaced the board with a better one. Yeah, so that... Yeah, yeah. And... Oh my God, I also loved the photo that you sent me with you in those glasses. So you bought those glasses in UAE, in Edgemont? Yeah. Two pairs of glasses. Wow. Yeah, I also like that. I also like that. So what else from today? Nothing that's special. Everything is just fine here, just like I said in Russian. He's fine. He's fine. We talked a lot actually. Oh my god. He really likes his new girlfriend. He really likes her. So she's from Asia. Yeah, she's from Asia, but I forgot to ask about the specific country, but she's from Asia. So yeah, they've been on a trip together recently. Yeah, I know. Yeah, of course. Oh my God, of course. Yeah, of course. True. And I don't know why, but honey, based on what I hear, It seems to me that finding your mate, your soulmate, in countries like the US or Canada is more difficult than other countries. I don't know why. Oh, it's also... I'm sorry. Go, go, go. Yeah, that's the only exception. Oh, my God. I love you, honey. So... What? I think about it? About what, honey? Yeah, I guess. No, no, no. It is. It is. I guess expectations. Yeah. Yeah. I took. Oh, my God. You outperform. First of all. Okay. Okay. You're so great that I never feel like I expect anything from you. So I just want you to be yourself. I just want you to be yourself. Did I pass today's test? Yeah... Yeah... I love you, honey. I love you, honey. So, what I was saying is that, yeah, it's just about expectation. I also want to show you this, our marketing sheet that we have just started. It's interesting. So, we're working on it to make it better and better. So step by step, actually. But for now, I can quickly show you. Are you interested in seeing it? Yes. Yes. Oh, I will tell you, honey. I will tell you. But before, yeah, of course, pixel ID, correct. But before saying that, this information is something that we scraped from Google Maps automatically. So we didn't buy this information. We just scraped it from Google Maps. It's amazing. We scraped it. Yes, I have the source code. So I have a code that scrapes Google Maps based on any business that you want. It can scrape hotels for you, schools for you, plumber services, dental clinics, doctors, gyms, beauty salons. And then it will give you a full list of all those businesses in a city. from Google Maps and also it works on Yandex Maps. I mean, a different code on Yandex Maps. I tested it. So, for example, in Moscow, I can give you a list of all dental clinics, of all gyms, of all beauty salons, of all, I don't know, mosques, of everything. But just to quote Yeah, and I have a code. So if you, anytime, if your friends need that source of information for marketing, I can give them for free. Because people usually buy this, sorry, sell this information. And one more thing, oh my God. So on Google Maps, there's no information about emails, okay? But as you can see, as you can see, we also have emails here. Okay, I'll tell you. So I wrote another code that opens each individual website and then searches for email field, right? And then if it can't find the email field, it just noted down for you. If not, it will try to find a contact us page on the website and then it goes there and they'll try to see if there's an email there. If not, it will say that there's no email. So as you saw, there were some fields that were not field, empty fields. It's just because they didn't mention their email there. So that's our marketing approach. It's going to be free for us just because we know how to script all this information. And yeah, so about the pixel ID, so we want to understand if someone opens an email or not. So there's this trick that you can do, you just put a pixel, just one pixel image, like it's very tiny, right? So what happens is that if the email opens, that image will be shown to them, but they see nothing because it's just one pixel, they see nothing. Okay, but as soon as this image opens we will receive a flag From our server that this guy open your email it is Yeah, anytime no, it's not I can if anytime you want to track track any email I can give you this code. Yeah, but the I I Yeah, but the idea is not from me. This idea, the idea of tracking email based on one pixel is something that everyone knows, but we just implemented it. Yeah, yeah. And there are some services that... this functionality. For example, there's a Chrome extension which is called Mail Tracker. So what it does, it just puts that one pixel in your emails. But problem is we cannot use Mail Tracker. Now, why? Because for sending emails, we have to use automation. We have to go row by row. So we can't use extension. So we have to programmatically programatically put that one pixel there. So that's why we need our server. And that's why you saw that pixel ID. That's going to be filled very soon. So yes, that's how our marketing is going on. Yeah, I just wanted you to see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see when the first US dollars are going to come to our pockets. Because that's the most important thing, honestly. Yeah, they will. Yeah, this will really come. True, true. Okay, okay. So, that was everything from my side on... And just one last thing. So before sending them marketing emails, we are sending them an email that represents that we are a customer. So we can see if they are willing to communicate even with the customer or not. No, no, no. For Canada. Yeah, for Canada. Okay. Yeah, so we present ourselves as a customer to see if they actually get back to us as a customer. And then we get their names, especially the managing directors or the owners. And for the second phase, we use another email address, our business email address, partner systems. And then we start sending them emails. That's our approach. Yes. Sorry, guys. If it took a lot of time for me to describe it. Wow. Interesting. Yeah. They have a website. True. True. Well, that's interesting that they don't have a website in Russia. That's actually something that I wasn't expecting. Of course. Of course. True. They don't have a website. True. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. True. True. And... And yeah, yeah, so I just wanted to show you our marketing plan. And also one more thing. So you told me that in Russia, stealing a car is not a thing. Like people don't steal cars. Am I right? Am I right? Did you tell me that? Some items. Yeah. And do you know if... Like a car security, smart car security systems. Is something trendy in Russia or no? Like security alarms, if someone breaks the window. Oh, so the car manufacturer gives that. Okay, okay. Sorry? So for the first year, it was free, just for the first year. She was a real woman? Toyota, right? Wow, I never heard this. Wow. Yeah. Do you think Russia is going to see electric cars any soon? Like, how about driverless cars? With, like, autonomous. Okay, okay. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, true, true. And... What honey? What? Okay. How are you honey? That's okay. I love you, my love. I love you so much. Sorry, say it again. That's okay. That's okay. No, no, that's okay. That's okay. So let's say goodbye. Let's say goodbye. Okay. Let me send you my kisses. Got it. Got it. Oh. Yeah, that's okay. Okay. Okay. There was more than one cat? Okay, okay, okay. Are we going to have bikini check tomorrow? We'll see. Okay, okay. And... Alright, honey, you're sleepy. I don't want to keep you here any longer. No, that's okay. I know. Walking in those malls actually takes so much. Yes, yes. True, true. Okay, honey. That's still a lot. Okay. Stay more? I love you, Yuliya. Okay, honey. Take care, please. I love you so much. I'm so proud of you. Everything I do is just for us and for our life. So... Of course. Of course. Yeah. And...
