We are hiring!

For over 25 years, Forever Cheese has been a leading importer of cheese and specialty food, sourcing exceptional products from Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Croatia. In the last two years, we have also welcomed two companies to the Forever Cheese family - W.A. Imports – an importer, manufacturer, and distributor of premium Asian specialty foods and Virginia Packing - a specialty foods co-packer for top quality cured meats, cheeses and other specialty foods.


We’ve built our business on the following values:

    Passion gives us purpose. We are energized by our work in the world of food—the discovery of products, the combinations of flavors, the sharing of recipes, the stories of our suppliers, the growth of our employees and the success of our customers.

    Nobody gets us like our community. We believe in the power of food to open minds, spark adventure and bring diverse people together.

Education is what we do. We are proud to be food nerds. From product origins and creator stories, to product care and knowledge, to storage, serving, and tasting—we bring our products to a wider audience, inspiring an interest and appreciation for the diversity of flavors and cultures that our products represent.


We strongly encourage your application, as we value the perspective, experience and potential that you could bring to Forever Cheese. Get in touch and join us on our journey!

    3+ years of experience creating content for a CPG food brand

    Leverage performance metrics to inform content strategy

Overview

Hello! We are a group of e-commerce brands in need of content creators. We are seeking talented and detail-oriented Content Specialists to join our team. The ideal candidate will possess a strong ability to create, edit, and manage high-quality content for various platforms.

You will be responsible for making video ads and content for our products. Creators will be provided with FREE samples of each product ($50+ Value). Showing face is not required in ads, but UGC style content showing face converts at a higher rate. In addition to your own research, we will also provide examples of successful ads for competing brands.

Our two brands can be found below:

Ace Finders: https://ace-finders.com/

MagSound: https://mag-sound.com/

***IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ***

Performance Bonus Structure (Based on Tracked Sales)

Base payment for each video submitted will be $10. Videos will be reviewed for eligibility. Videos must be of acceptable quality and must contain a hook, a good product description, and a clear CTA (Call To Action).

In addition to the $10 per video payment, you'll be eligible for the following cumulative bonuses based on how many sales your content helps generate:

    $5,000 in sales → $25 bonus
    $10,000 in sales → +$75 bonus (total bonuses = $100)
    $25,000 in sales → +$100 bonus (total bonuses = $300)
    $50,000 in sales → +$175 bonus (total bonuses = $750)
    $100,000 in sales → +$250 bonus (total bonuses = $1,000)

Each video will only be about 30 seconds to 1 minute long, so not much content is needed for each video.

Sales will be tracked using our meta ads dashboard.

Bonuses are cumulative: the more your content performs, the more you earn.

As a growing brand, we value performance-based incentives and are willing to grow and create long-lasting relationships with our creators. This role requires a blend of creativity and technical skills, as well as a commitment to maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and style. The Content Specialist will play a crucial role in enhancing our brand's voice and ensuring that all content aligns with our strategic goals.

Responsibilities & Perks

    Research and gather information on various topics to create engaging content that resonates with our target audience.
    Write, edit, and proofread content for clarity, and grammar.
    Conduct thorough fact-checking to ensure the accuracy of all published materials.
    Assist in proposal writing efforts by crafting compelling narratives that highlight our services and expertise.
    Edit existing content for improvement and optimization based on feedback and performance metrics.

Experience

    Proven experience in content creation, editing, and proofreading across various formats.
    Strong research skills with the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.
    Experience in creative writing and technical writing is highly desirable.
    Excellent attention to detail and commitment to producing high-quality work.
    Ability to work independently.
    Strong organizational skills with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously while meeting deadlines.

We’re not looking for traditional salespeople — instead, we’re seeking tech-savvy content creators who genuinely enjoy testing cool products and making short-form videos in their free time.

If you love experimenting with new gadgets, filming unboxings, product demos, or lifestyle content, and you’re looking to earn extra income on your own schedule, this is a great opportunity. No sales pressure — just make authentic content and earn commissions based on the impact your videos have.

Each applicant will be interviewed. When applying, please include any previous work that you have created.

Job Type: Contract

Pay: $100.00 per day
